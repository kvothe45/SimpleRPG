developers:  Ralph E Beard IV (UI and refactoring); Jesse Lott (game logic and base game)

This is about as simple a rogulike RPG as I can think to create without resorting to a rogulike library to help.  Wanting to get the hang of the logic of it all.  This is set to break the window into different sections and to treat those sections independently.  Using Jesse Lott's game engine, this will bring a simple graphical representation to that game.
